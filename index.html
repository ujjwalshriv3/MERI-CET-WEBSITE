      "Knowledge is power and library is the powerhouse". Books are the best teachers and counselors. To synchronize theory and practice, the journals, magazines and newspapers are very helpful. A Library is a collection of information, resources and services, organized for use, and maintained by a responsible body. Libraries inform the public of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. A modern Library provides educational resources to students and teachers through publications and other electronic media.

The library is spanned in a 3000 sqft building with air-conditioning facility and it can accommodate 350 students for reading.

The library is computerized and is well equipped with more than 7000 volumes of books various disciplines, 55 magazines and periodicals. The college has invested more than Rs 35 lakhs for the library in the last 4 years for the purchase of the books.

The college spends a minimum of Rs 5 lakhs each year on the books and Rs 2 lakhs for subscribing the journals and periodicals.
